# Browse the public datasets here https://www.opensciencedatacloud.org/publicdata/?commons_type=General​ and here: https://www.opensciencedatacloud.org/publicdata/?commons_type=Environmental​ and choose a dataset to work on based on your scientific interests. Note that some datasets are very large. In that case, make sure that it is possible to extract subsets of it easily and stage them in SSC, etc.
# Design a scalable data processing solution for the chosen dataset, demonstrating your knowledge of key concepts and tools introduced in this course. Typically, massive datasets needs to be analyzed in stages, where the first step tend to consist of some form of data reduction, for example a filter or feature extraction. In this stage, all data needs to be accessed and the output of the operation is a subset or reduced dataset more amenable to interactive analysis.
