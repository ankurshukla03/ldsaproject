# Choose the dataset
I am inclined towards city of chicago dataset as it is available in JSON format so there will be no problem reading the dataset only problem can be that it is small dataset so we need to some duplication of data.

#what technology we will be using and why
Still not sure but maybe spark as it is much faster than hadoop but still not good enough reason as we have 9.5 gb data so even if we choose hadoop there won't be much of a difference

#what we want to preprocess from the data
what we can filter out in data

#what we want to analyze or what aspect we should analyze
